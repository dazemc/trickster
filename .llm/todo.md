# Trickster TODO

The work list, in build order. `AGENTS.md` is the constitution; this file is
the queue. Remove items as they land — do not check them off, do not let it
rot.

Authorized work only: the queue grants exactly the steps it lists, top-down,
and never overrides the constitution, `.llm/workflow.md`, or the domain notes
(see `AGENTS.md` → Instruction precedence).

Every step is one action with its own done-criteria. Work top-down, one step
at a time: implement it, prove it with `flutter analyze` + `flutter test`
(plus a release build when native code changes), then remove it. Never remove
an untested step; never batch multiple steps into one change.

Sizes: S <1 day, M 1–3 days, L 3+ days.

## Phase 1 — Bloc migration

Riverpod → `flutter_bloc`, explicit events and states, no Cubits. Every
state class ships `toJson`/`fromJson` from day one (convention only, no
HydratedBloc) so `tricksterctl status` and agent runtime review read real
state later. Debug/profile builds run a verbose `BlocObserver`
(transitions + create/close + errors + timing) to stderr; release stays
silent per the logging rules.

## Phase 2 — feel (behaves like Denial)

## Phase 3 — parity (absent modules)

## Phase 4 — finish


## Phase 5 — packaging and release


## Phase 6 — follow-ups


## Phase 7 — version sync


## Phase 9 — parity and release hygiene

- [ ] **9.4 AUR submission** (S). `packaging/aur/trickster-bin`. The recipe
      is verified and pinned but not published to aur.archlinux.org; submit
      it (needs the user's AUR account and SSH key) and confirm the package
      page and a clean `makepkg` from the published sources. Done when: the
      package is live and the docs link to it.
- [ ] **9.5 release automation** (M). `.github/workflows/`. A tag-triggered
      workflow builds the Arch package with `check()`, hashes it, updates
      the AUR pin from the built artifact, and attaches the asset to the
      GitHub release. Done when: a dry-run tag produces the asset and pin
      without manual steps.

## Phase 8 — settings application (Denial parity)

The bar stopped at "no settings window in v1"; the user replaced that with
a settings application: the same binary run in settings mode
(`trickster-settings`), its own process and engine with no strip surfaces,
writing through the running bar's control socket (file transport as
fallback) and covering exactly the settings the bar has. The version stays
0.1.0 until the user calls a bump.
