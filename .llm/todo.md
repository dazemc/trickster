# Trickster TODO

The work list, in build order. `AGENTS.md` is the constitution; this file is
the queue. Remove items as they land — do not check them off, do not let it
rot.

Authorized work only: the queue grants exactly the steps it lists, top-down,
and never overrides the constitution, `.llm/workflow.md`, or the domain notes
(see `AGENTS.md` → Instruction precedence).

Every step is one action with its own done-criteria. Work top-down, one step
at a time: implement it, prove it with `flutter analyze` + `flutter test`
(plus a release build when native code changes), then remove it. Never remove
an untested step; never batch multiple steps into one change.

Sizes: S <1 day, M 1–3 days, L 3+ days.

## Phase 1 — Bloc migration

Riverpod → `flutter_bloc`, explicit events and states, no Cubits. Every
state class ships `toJson`/`fromJson` from day one (convention only, no
HydratedBloc) so `tricksterctl status` and agent runtime review read real
state later. Debug/profile builds run a verbose `BlocObserver`
(transitions + create/close + errors + timing) to stderr; release stays
silent per the logging rules.

## Phase 2 — feel (behaves like Denial)

## Phase 3 — parity (absent modules)

## Phase 4 — finish


## Phase 5 — packaging and release


## Phase 6 — follow-ups


## Decisions pending

- [ ] Lua configuration: full replacement vs. optional power layer vs.
      computed-values-only vs. stay with KEY=VALUE. Do not start without an
      explicit call.
