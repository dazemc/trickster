# Trickster TODO

The work list, in build order. `AGENTS.md` is the constitution; this file is
the queue. Remove items as they land — do not check them off, do not let it
rot.

Authorized work only: the queue grants exactly the steps it lists, top-down,
and never overrides the constitution, `.llm/workflow.md`, or the domain notes
(see `AGENTS.md` → Instruction precedence).

Every step is one action with its own done-criteria. Work top-down, one step
at a time: implement it, prove it with `flutter analyze` + `flutter test`
(plus a release build when native code changes), then remove it. Never remove
an untested step; never batch multiple steps into one change.

Sizes: S <1 day, M 1–3 days, L 3+ days.

## Phase 1 — Bloc migration

Riverpod → `flutter_bloc`, explicit events and states, no Cubits. Every
state class ships `toJson`/`fromJson` from day one (convention only, no
HydratedBloc) so `tricksterctl status` and agent runtime review read real
state later. Debug/profile builds run a verbose `BlocObserver`
(transitions + create/close + errors + timing) to stderr; release stays
silent per the logging rules.

## Phase 2 — feel (behaves like Denial)

## Phase 3 — parity (absent modules)

## Phase 4 — finish


## Phase 5 — packaging and release


## Phase 6 — follow-ups


## Phase 7 — version sync


## Phase 8 — settings application (Denial parity)

The bar stopped at "no settings window in v1"; the user replaced that with
a settings application: the same binary run in settings mode
(`trickster-settings`), its own process and engine with no strip surfaces,
writing through the running bar's control socket (file transport as
fallback) and covering exactly the settings the bar has. The version stays
0.1.0 until the user calls a bump.

- [ ] **8.10 about page** (S). Bar and protocol versions plus repository
      links, degrading cleanly when the bar is not running. Done when: it
      reads versions from a live bar and from a stopped one.
- [ ] **8.11 packaging** (M). The Arch package builds and installs the second
      bundle with a `trickster-settings.desktop`; extend the AUR recipe and
      the version-sync test to the app. Done when: the package installs both
      binaries and the desktop entry opens the app.
