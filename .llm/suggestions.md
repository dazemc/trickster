# Trickster suggestions

Agent-proposed, user-reviewed suggestions. If you see something the queue,
the constitution, or the code gets wrong — a missed Denial parallel, a
performance trap, a config wart, a docs gap — propose it here so the next
session sees it. Standing rules and instructions belong in `AGENTS.md`, not
here.

Non-authoritative: entries inform decisions but bind nothing until the user
escalates them to `.llm/todo.md` (see `AGENTS.md` → Instruction precedence).

## Rules

- Entries must be **absolutely needed**: they prevent a future mistake,
  unblock queued work, or record a decision with its reason. Brainstorming,
  nice-to-haves, and restatements of `.llm/todo.md` do not belong here.
- One entry per issue. Keep it to five lines: what, where, why, and what
  to do about it.
- Append after every change: review the touched code for misses and add
  entries that meet the bar; findings never live only in the transcript.
- Remove an entry in the same change that resolves it — same discipline as
  `.llm/todo.md`.
- After finishing any `.llm/todo.md` step, re-read this file and update it, but
  only if something meets the bar above. No obligatory edits. Silence is a
  valid review outcome.
- At a phase boundary, walk every open entry with the user and settle its
  decision — keep, condense, move, escalate, or dismiss — before the next
  phase starts.

## Open suggestions

- **The workspace rail diverges from Denial v0.4.0.** Denial centers a
  numbered workspace card in the strip and deforms the active lens on
  switch (`workspaceIndicatorTakeoff` 72ms / `Travel` 168ms / `Settle` 80ms,
  MD3 emphasized curves); Trickster renders state-colored dots in the
  trailing module cluster with a plain aligned lens. Port the centered rail,
  or record the dots/cluster choice as a deliberate divergence in
  `.llm/porting.md`.
